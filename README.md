# Background_Subtraction_OpenCv
Implementation of background subtraction using OpenCV to detect motion and foreground objects in videos and image sequences.


🕵️ Background Subtraction using OpenCV


This project implements background subtraction, a fundamental technique in computer vision used to detect moving objects or extract foreground elements from video streams and image sequences. 
 The implementation utilizes OpenCV’s built-in background subtraction models for dynamic and real-time applications.

🎯 Objective


To extract the foreground (moving objects) from a static background using frame-wise analysis and background modeling techniques. This is commonly used in:


Motion detection

Object tracking

Surveillance systems
